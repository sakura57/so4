# Spaced Out 4

Spaced Out 4 is a 2D, top-down space-themed action-adventure game with RPG elements. It is inspired by the Spaced Out series of games by Sean Hunter and intended as a spiritual successor.

The game is written primarily in C++, using SFML for graphics, audio and rendering, as well as Dear ImGUI for UI. SO4 is in a pre-alpha state; everything you see is subject to change, and lots of it.

SO4 is intended to be heavily moddable, with most game data and settings stored in INI files. In addition, the game has a Lua script processor, and missions, systems, and events are represented as Lua scripts.

## Considerations

Seeing as the game is in a pre-alpha state, many of the assets (primarily graphics and audio assets) are temporary, and taken from various freely available collections found on the Web.

I've attempted to credit as many authors as I can. The credits list can be found in the credits folder.

IMPORTANT: If you notice that your work is included in this repository, and your name was not properly recorded in the credits file, don't hesitate to contact me so that I can credit you for your work.

## License

SO4 is published under the terms of the GNU GPLv2. This game is a product of several years of my time of off-and-on work, for my own fun. I have no intention to turn it into a commercial product, and as such it will be significantly more useful as an open-source project.
