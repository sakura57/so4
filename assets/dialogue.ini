text = The most important piece of all this is the cerebral implant chip, which allows your brain to communicate directly with the ship's computer, essentially letting you control the ship as if it were your own hand or foot.

[node_9]
id = 9

character = Roberts
text = It will take some time to get used to, but soon you'll be in a league of your own. As you gain experience in combat, you'll discover more unique ways to leverage the ship's systems. All the ship's systems are at your disposal, so nothing is impossible.

text = I'm going to run you through a simple training exercise, just to ensure everything's in working order. Remember, if you think about firing your guns, it'll happen, thanks to the implant. If you're feeling overwhelmed though, feel free to fall back to the manual controls:

text = W to fire the main thruster, S to reverse, and A and D to strafe left and right, respectively. To rotate your ship, just point the mouse to where you want to aim. Right click fires the guns, and left click selects a target. Remember, it's important to select targets so you'll get an aim assist reticle.

text = Lately, the Reavers, a local band of pirates, have been getting increasingly bold. They used to just raid the occasional transport passing through, but they've stepped up their game significantly. Their attacks are more organized and deliberate, and they're even making incursions into Callisto Beta.
