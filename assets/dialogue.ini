text = You're a part of Project Orange Sky, an experimental project by the TSF. The project's goal is to create the "perfect pilot" by means of cybernetic augmentation, who we're calling Elite pilots.

text = The most important piece of all this is the cerebral implant chip, which allows your brain to communicate directly with the ship's computer, essentially letting you control the ship as if it were your own hand or foot.

[node_9]
id = 9
text = Not that we know of. The implant works wirelessly, so you won't even notice it, and it can interface with most modern ships. In theory, the design is completely safe, so you have nothing to worry about.
responses = 9

[node_10]
id = 10
text = It will take some getting used to at first, but soon you'll be in a league of your own. As you gain experience in combat, you'll discover more unique ways to leverage the ship's systems, say, overcharging the laser projectors to produce more powerful shots, as just one example. All the ship's systems are at your disposal, so nothing is impossible.

[node_11]
id = 11
text = I'm going to run you through a simple training exercise, just to ensure everything's in working order. Remember, if you think about firing a thruster, it'll happen, thanks to the implant. If you're feeling overwhelmed though, feel free to fall back to the manual controls: 
responses = 11

[node_12]
id = 12
text = W to fire the main thruster, S to reverse, and A and D to strafe left and right, respectively. To rotate your ship, just point the mouse to where you want to aim. Right click fires the guns, and left click selects a target. Remember, it's important to select targets so you'll get an aim assist reticle.

[node_14]

[node_15]

text = As you might know, trial participants aren't officially a part of the TSF. In fact, we allow participants a great deal of freedom, and they may do as they wish during the trial, within the law of course. All we ask is that you report back periodically to upload your CIU data so we can continue to refine and improve the unit. However, once in a while we do end up with a "rogue" participant who goes off on their own, and needs to be dealt with. The most recent is a man named Jericho Langley.

[node_19]
id = 19
text = He's an Elite like yourself, except he decided early on that his new power was best used for personal gain rather than the collective benefit of the Terran sectors. We lost contact with him for several weeks, but we learned after some time that he had joined the Reavers, a local band of pirates and scrappers. He climbed quickly within their ranks and is now something of a leader.

[node_20]
id = 20
text = We don't know exactly where he is, but Callisto Alpha is a safe bet. That sector technically belongs to the TSF, but it's long been a no-go zone. We suspect the Reavers have a secret base there. Search around for the base, and you'll probably find Jericho.
responses = 20 21

[node_21]
id = 21
text = He's an Elite like yourself, so take extreme caution. Try and find some upgrades for that equipment, you'll probably want something that packs a bit more punch than standard-issue weapons. You can pick something up from the equipment dealer on the Bremerhaven. Just target the docking buoy and press T to send a landing request.
