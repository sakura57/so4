text = The most important piece of all this is the cerebral implant chip, which allows your brain to communicate directly with the ship's computer, essentially letting you control the ship as if it were your own hand or foot.

text = Not that we know of. The implant works wirelessly, so you won't even notice it, and it can interface with most modern ships. In theory, the design is completely safe, so you have nothing to worry about.

character = Roberts
text = It will take some getting used to at first, but soon you'll be in a league of your own. As you gain experience in combat, you'll discover more unique ways to leverage the ship's systems, say, overcharging the laser projectors to produce more powerful shots, as just one example. All the ship's systems are at your disposal, so nothing is impossible.

text = I'm going to run you through a simple training exercise, just to ensure everything's in working order. Remember, if you think about firing a thruster, it'll happen, thanks to the implant. If you're feeling overwhelmed though, feel free to fall back to the manual controls:

text = W to fire the main thruster, S to reverse, and A and D to strafe left and right, respectively. To rotate your ship, just point the mouse to where you want to aim. Right click fires the guns, and left click selects a target. Remember, it's important to select targets so you'll get an aim assist reticle.
