# How to Play

This document describes what there is to do in-game for those new to SO4.

As always, this document is subject to change.

## Main Menu

After the game starts, you're presented with the main menu. You have several options to choose from:

- New (Story Mode) which starts a new game. You can choose your character's name, as well as your starting equipment. Currently, your character's name determines the name of your save file, which is saved automatically every time you launch from a station.
- Load (Story Mode) loads a previous savegame. You must provide the name of your character.
- Arena starts a "training room" where you're attacked by pirates repeatedly. The goal is to survive as long as possible. Periodically, you're docked with a station to refuel and rearm.
- Options allows you to change several different options, including sound volume, resolution and graphics quality, as well as choose a control scheme. It's recommended to stay with the default "Keyboard & Mouse" control scheme, and this guide assumes you're using the Keyboard & Mouse control scheme.

## HUD

While in space, there are a number of different HUD views and interfaces.

There are several HUD views which are always present on the screen:

- Systems, which shows the status of your Hull, Shields, Energy, and Mind pools.
- Debug, which shows the number of active instances, particles, and sounds
- Equipment, which contains a list of all your mounted weapons. You can hover over weapon names to see their stats, or enable and disable weapons by clicking on them
- Abilities, with the ability hotbar. These are your abilities for use during combat, which you can activate by pressing the corresponding number key
- Radar, with a list of nearby ships and satellites

The HUD layout is highly customizable; HUD views can be resized, moved around the screen, or minimized.

## Spaceflight Controls

When mouse-tracking is enabled, simply point the mouse anywhere on the screen and your ship will orient itself toward that point. You can enable and disable mouse tracking by pressing Control.

Right-click to fire guns, and press the spacebar to fire missiles.

Thruster controls:

- Press W for forward throttle
- Press S for reverse
- Press A to strafe left
- Press D to strafe right

There are additional interfaces that can be brought up by pressing certain keys.

- I shows the Inventory, with your money and metal, all mounted equipment as well as equipment in your cargo hold
- U shows the Character Sheet, with your character's name, level, and XP
- Y shows the Abilities window, with all abilities that your character has learned. From here you can drag and drop abilities to the hotbar for use in combat.
- G shows the Skill Tree window. Here, you can invest skill points that you earn after leveling up. You can hover over any skill in the tree to read what perks it gives.
- K shows the Material Bank. Here, you can view the materials you've acquired through asteroid mining.
- M shows the Sector Map.

### Interacting with the World

The T key is the "interact" key. It has a different action depending on what kind of object you've targeted.

- For docking buoys, your ship will begin the landing sequence and you'll land on the base.
- For jump buoys, your ship will initiate a jump to the next sector.
- For asteroids, this will run a scan of the asteroid, bringing up an analysis window where you can view material deposits and examine the materials' properties.

### The Skill Tree

Every time you level up, you gain one free skill point. This skill point can be invested into a skill on the skill tree.

The skill tree is composed of three branches:

- Offense, which provides offensive abilities and increases your offensive stats
- Defense, which provides defensive abilities and increases your defensive stats
- Spacefaring, which provides miscellaneous abilities and increases utility stats

Each tree has three lines, representing three "disciplines" within that branch.

Within the Offense tree:

- Energy Specialist line, which increases the Laser Proficiency and Plasma Proficiency stats, and grants laser barrage abilities.
- Kinetic Specialist line, which increases the Kinetic Proficiency stat, and grants kinetic barrage abilities.
- Missile Specialist line, which increases the Missile Proficiency stat, and grants missile barrage abilities.

Within the Defense tree:

- Nanobot Knowledge line, which increases the Hull Integrity stat and grants healing abilities.
- Shield Expertise line, which increases the Shield Knowledge stat and grants shield restoration and manipulation abilities.
- Maneuvering line, which increases the Evasion stat.

Within the Spacefaring tree:

- Bartering line, which increases the Bartering stat.
- Hacking line, which increases the Hacking stat and grants various utility abilities.
- Scrapping line, which increases the Luck stat.

Additionally, if you fill out all three lines within a branch, you can take a final Legendary skill within that branch, granting huge bonuses to all stats in that branch and additional powerful abilities.

### Stats

Stats, increased by investing skill points into various skills, have different effects on your character. These include:

- Laser Proficiency, which increases damage dealt by laser-type weapons
- Plasma Proficiency, which increases damage dealt by plasma-type weapons
- Kinetic Proficiency, which increases damage dealt by kinetic weapons
- Missile Proficiency, which increases damage dealt by missiles.
- Hull Integrity, which grants resistance to damage dealt to hull
- Shield Knowledge, which grants resistance to damage dealt to shields
- Evasion, which grants bonuses to ship engine power and maneuverability
- Bartering, which affects equipment prices and metal exchange rates
- Hacking, which increases the effectiveness of Hacking abilities
- Luck, which increases the amount of scrap metal looted from destroyed ships, as well as the chances of acquiring rare drops

### The Sector Map

The Sector Map shows the name and layout of the current sector you're in.

Key:

- The small green square is your current location
- Small yellow squares are bases
- Small blue circles are jump buoys
- Large white shaded zones are asteroid fields

## Baseside Controls

When you land on a base, you're presented with the Base Hub panel. From here, you can visit the Equipment Trader, the Junk Trader, or the Mission Board. Finally, you can click Launch to leave the base and return to space.

### The Equipment Dealer

The Equipment Dealer window is separated into three views.

The first view, Trader, shows everything the dealer has for sale. You can right-click items to see their price, and in the same menu, you can either choose to buy the item, in which case it's loaded into your cargo hold, or Buy & Mount the item, in which case it's mounted into the first free equipment slot on your ship.

The second view, Cargo Hold, shows everything in your cargo hold. You can right-click on an item, to either Mount it, or Sell it to the Equipment Trader. When you sell an item, you receive half of its "sticker price".

The third view, Equipped, shows your ship's current loadout. You can right-click on items to either De-mount them, placing them back in your cargo hold, or Sell them to the dealer.

### The Junk Trader

From the Junk Trader window, you can buy and sell Scrap Metal you've obtained by destroying other ships in combat. Keep an eye on the different rates shown at the top of the window.

- Base Rate represents the base buy price of metal on this particular base, before modifiers are taken into account. This rate is specific to each base and never changes or fluctuates.
- Final Buy Rate represents the price that you will pay if you buy metal on this base, _including modifiers._ This is affected by your character's Bartering stat.
- Final Sell Rate represents the price that you will receive if you sell metal on this base, _including modifiers._ This is affected by your character's Bartering stat.

Fill in an amount in the input box, which you can use the + and - buttons to increment or decrement respectively. Then, click the Buy or Sell button to buy or sell that amount of metal.

### Mission Board

From the Mission Board, you can take a job from the particular faction that operates that base. Currently, the mission description and reward is the same and specific to each base, but the events that occur during the mission and the strength and number of enemies is randomized.

In the Description box, you can read about the task you'll need to perform to get your reward. Failing to complete the task, by for example fleeing from any enemies encountered, will mean no chance of a reward.

After pressing the Accept button and returning to space, the mission sequence will begin.
